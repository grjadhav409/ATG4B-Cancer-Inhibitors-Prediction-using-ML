# Discription
ATG4B has been implicated in several diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, lung endotoxemia/ sepsis, colitis, ischemia/reperfusion, Huntingtonâ€™s disease, and various forms of cancer. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have proven effective methods in the chemistry domain. Especially in drug discovery machine learning assisted QSAR models have played an important role.  However, none of them has been applied to ATG4B. 

  To this end, we carefully compiled a set of 373 compounds from the ChEMBL database that have been assayed against ATG4B. Then we calculated different kinds of descriptors for these compounds including various types of fingerprints and physiochemical properties of molecules. Some of the popular machine learning regression algorithms were applied initially to this data for the sake of comparing various algorithm performances. Then best performing models were hyper tuned for finalization. Random forest and support vector regression have given the best performance.
